# Deploying Bookkeeper

Here, we briefly describe how to [install](#installing-bookkeeper-cluster)/[update](#updating-bookkeeper-cluster)/[uninstall](#uninstalling-the-bookkeeper-cluster)/[configure](#configuration) bookkeeper clusters atop kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

  - Kubernetes 1.15+ with Beta APIs
  - Helm 3+
  - An existing Apache Zookeeper 3.6.1 cluster. This can be easily deployed using our [Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator)
  - Bookkeeper Operator. Please refer [this](../../charts/bookkeeper-operator/README.md)

## Installing Bookkeeper Cluster

To install the bookkeeper cluster, use the following commands:

```
$ helm repo add pravega https://charts.pravega.io
$ helm repo update
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/bookkeeper --version=[VERSION] --set zookeeperUri=[ZOOKEEPER_HOST] --set pravegaClusterName=[PRAVEGA_CLUSTER_NAME] -n [NAMESPACE]
```
where:
- **[RELEASE_NAME]** is the release name for the bookkeeper chart
- **[VERSION]** can be any stable release version for bookkeeper from 0.5.0 onwards
- **[ZOOKEEPER_HOST]** is the zookeeper service endpoint of your zookeeper cluster deployment (default value of this field is `zookeeper-client:2181`)
- **[NAMESPACE]** is the namespace in which you wish to deploy the bookkeeper cluster (default value for this field is `default`) The bookkeeper cluster must be installed in the same namespace as the zookeeper cluster.

>Note: If we provide [RELEASE_NAME] same as chart name, cluster name will be same as release-name. But if we are providing a different name for release(other than bookkeeper in this case), cluster name will be [RELEASE_NAME]-[chart-name]. However, cluster name can be overridden by providing `--set  fullnameOverride=[CLUSTER_NAME]` along with helm install command.

This command deploys bookkeeper on the Kubernetes cluster in its default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

>Note: If the operator version is 0.1.3 or below and bookkeeper version is 0.9.0 or above, you would need to set the JVM options as shown below.
```
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] pravega/bookkeeper --version=[VERSION] --set zookeeperUri=[ZOOKEEPER_HOST] --set pravegaClusterName=[PRAVEGA_CLUSTER_NAME] -n [NAMESPACE] --set 'jvmOptions.extraOpts={-XX:+UseContainerSupport,-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions}'
```

Once the bookkeeper cluster with release name `bookkeeper` has been created, use the following command to verify that the cluster instances and its components are being created.

```
$ kubectl get bk
NAME                   VERSION   DESIRED MEMBERS   READY MEMBERS      AGE
bookkeeper             0.7.0     3                 1                  25s
```

After a couple of minutes, all cluster members should become ready.

```
$ kubectl get bk
NAME                   VERSION   DESIRED MEMBERS   READY MEMBERS     AGE
bookkeeper             0.7.0     3                 3                 2m
```

```
$ kubectl get all -l bookkeeper_cluster=bookkeeper
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/bookkeeper-bookie-0                           1/1     Running   0          2m
pod/bookkeeper-bookie-1                           1/1     Running   0          2m
pod/bookkeeper-bookie-2                           1/1     Running   0          2m

NAME                                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)              AGE
service/bookkeeper-bookie-headless              ClusterIP   None          <none>        3181/TCP             2m

NAME                                            DESIRED   CURRENT     AGE
statefulset.apps/bookkeeper-bookie              3         3           2m
```

By default, a `BookkeeperCluster` is reachable using this kind of headless service URL for each pod:
```
http://bookkeeper-bookie-0.bookkeeper-bookie-headless.bookkeeper-bookie:3181
```
## Updating Bookkeeper Cluster

For updating the bookkeeper cluster, use the following command

```
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME]  --version=[VERSION]  --set replicas=5
```
 we can also update other configurable parameters at run time. For changing options `minorCompactionInterval` to `1900` use the below command.

 ```
  helm upgrade bookkeeper charts/bookkeeper --set-string options."minorCompactionInterval=1900"
  ```
Please refer [upgrade](../../doc/upgrade-cluster.md) for upgrading cluster versions.

## Uninstalling the Bookkeeper cluster

To uninstall/delete the bookkeeper cluster, use the following command:

```
$ helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
> Note: If blockOwnerDeletion had been set to false during bookkeeper installation, the PVCs won't be removed automatically while uninstalling the bookkeeper chart, and would need to be deleted manually.

Once the Bookkeeper cluster has been deleted, make sure to check that the zookeeper metadata has been cleaned up before proceeding with the deletion of the operator. This can be confirmed with the presence of the following log message in the operator logs.
```
zookeeper metadata deleted
```

However, if the operator fails to delete this metadata from zookeeper, you will instead find the following log message in the operator logs.
```
failed to cleanup [CLUSTER_NAME] metadata from zookeeper (znode path: /pravega/[PRAVEGA_CLUSTER_NAME]): <error-msg>
```

The operator additionally sends out a `ZKMETA_CLEANUP_ERROR` event to notify the user about this failure. The user can check this event by doing `kubectl get events`. The following is the sample describe output of the event that is generated by the operator in such a case
```
